# Coffee-Machine-Project
This is an automated coffee machine project written in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project aims to create a user-friendly coffee machine that allows users to select a coffee type, check ingredient availability, insert coins, calculate change, and enjoy their favorite coffee with ease.

# Select a Coffee: Users can choose from a menu of available coffee types such as espresso, cappuccino, latte.
# Check Ingredient Availability: Before brewing the coffee, the machine checks if it has enough coffee beans, milk, water, and other necessary ingredients to prepare the selected coffee.
# Insert Coins: Users can insert coins to pay for their coffee. The machine calculates the total amount inserted.
# Calculate Change: If the amount inserted exceeds the coffee's cost, the machine calculates and returns the change to the user.
# Make the Coffee: Once the payment is complete and the ingredients are available, the coffee machine brews the selected coffee and dispenses it to the user.
